    <h3>Absolute War</h3>
    <p>
    I'm looking forward to this new game by the designer of No Retreat. What intrigues me the most about this one are the irregular shaped regions. I believe on his other games there were nice hexes for movement. 
    </p>
    <p>I'm always a sucker for cards in a game as I find they can quickly introduce me to the history of that period. </p>
    <p>It does appear that he's borrowed alot from the famous No Retreat series but deviated from several things, so I'm hoping this will be a nice refresher on the system of which I already own several games.</p>

    <h3>Normandy '44</h3>
    <p>This title should be a no brainer considering it's in the same family of games as the Ardennes and Golan games. The only one that I've tried so far is Ardennes 44, but it was great. Just enough level of chrome to still be playable but also to make you feel like you understand some of the tricky decisions the generals had to make on the battlefield.</p>
